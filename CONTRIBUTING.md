# Contributing

This is a small project, born out of frustration that the mature Ruby on Rails ecosystem does not provide a linter for `.js.erb` and `.html.erb` files.

I'm happy to accept your contributions! Please open an issue beforehand. This way, you get the chance to get feedback on your idea or a bug before you start working on the respective implementation/fix and therefore avoid wasting time on a PR that might not be merged.

As usual, common sense applies, so be respectful and constructive in your communication. PR comments will usually be short and concise. Please don't take them personally, it's a chance to learn and improve (both sides of course).
