# Contributing

This is a small project, born out of frustration that the mature Ruby on Rails ecosystem does not provide a linter for `.js.erb` and `.html.erb` files.

I'm happy to accept your contributions! Please open an issue beforehand to discuss your ideas or to report a bug to not waste some time on a PR that might not be merged.

As usual, common sense applies, so be respectful and constructive in your communication. PRs comments will usually be short and concise. Please don't take them personally, it's a chance to learn and improve (both sides of course).
